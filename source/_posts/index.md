# About Me
I'm a fifth-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science. My primary research focus spans ​​systems architecture​​ and ​​resource virtualization​​, with specialized expertise in:

- Operating Systems (Virtualization, Linux kernel, and resource management)
- Lightweight Virtualization and Secure Containerization (WebAssembly, Unikernels, micro-VMs)
- Disaggregated Memory systems (RDMA, CXL)
